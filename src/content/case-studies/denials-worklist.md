title: "Denials Worklist Cleanup"
problem: "Denials were mixed with pending statuses, making it difficult to prioritize follow-up. The AR team was spending too much time re-researching the same claims."
actions:
  - "Analyzed denial patterns by payer and category over 3 months"
  - "Built a structured tracker with payer, denial category, and next action date"
  - "Standardized status notes for cleaner handoffs between team members"
  - "Created a weekly review cadence for aging items over 60 days"
results:
  - "Reduced 'no-touch' AR by 45% within the first month"
  - "Improved team follow-up consistency and accountability"
  - "Cut average denial resolution time from 21 days to 12 days"
tools:
  - "Excel/Google Sheets"
  - "Payer Portals"
  - "AdvancedMD"
order: 1
