  - "Implemented daily standup to review priority queue status"
  - "Set up automated alerts for claims approaching filing limits"
results:
  - "Eliminated timely filing write-offs completely after implementation"
  - "Increased collections by 18% in the first quarter"
  - "Improved team morale through clearer daily objectives"
